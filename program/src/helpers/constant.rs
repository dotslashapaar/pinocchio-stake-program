// stake history, but we only care that stake we are dealing with in the present
// epoch has been fully (de)activated. this means, as long as one epoch has
// passed since activation where all prior stake had escaped warmup/cooldown,
// we can pretend the rate has always beein 9% without issue. so we do that
